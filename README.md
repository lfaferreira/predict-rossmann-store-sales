# Predict Rossmann Store Sales
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

## 1 - Introduction
In their first Kaggle competition, Rossmann is challenging you to predict 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany. Reliable sales forecasts enable store managers to create effective staff schedules that increase productivity and motivation. By helping Rossmann create a robust prediction model, you will help store managers stay focused on whatâ€™s most important to them: their customers and their teams! 

## 2 - Data Understanding
The **Rossmann Store Sales dataset**, available on **Kaggle**, is divided into training, store and test files. The combination of the training and store datasets corresponds to **1017209 rows and 18 columns**, where the data is divided into numerical and categorical, with the existence of missing data.

The dictionary of names for the training and store files is as follows:
